            <b>Fire Island Beach</b> is a barrier of sand, stretching for twenty miles
            along the south coast of Long Island, and separating the Great South Bay
            from the Atlantic ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
            To reach it, you must make a sail of from three to seven miles, and once
            upon it, you find it a wild, desolate, solitary spot, wind-searched and
            surf-pounded.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its inner shore is covered with a growth of tide-wet sedge, with here
            and there a spot where dry meadow comes down to make a landing-place.
        </p>
        <p>
            The outline of this inner shore is most irregular, curving and bending
            in and out and back upon itself, making coves and points and creeks and
            channels, and often pushing out in flats with not water enough on them
            at low tide to wet your ankles.
        </p>
        <p>
            A third of the distance across the Beach, the meadow ends and sand
            begins. This slopes gradually up for another third of the distance, to
            the foot of the sand hills, which seem tumbled into their places by some
            mighty power, sometimes three tiers of them deep, sometimes two, and
            sometimes only one.
        </p>
        <p>
            These sand hills are the most striking features of the Beach. The
            biggest of them are not more than sixty feet high, yet so hard a feat is
            it to climb to the top, and so extended is the view below you—on one
            side the wide Bay, on the other, the ocean stretching its restless
            surface to the horizon—that you feel yourself upon an elevation tenfold
            as high.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these hills the wind makes a great galloping, whirling out deep
            bowl-shape hollows among them, and piling the shifting sand upon their
            summits. Now and then you will notice a hill with its shoulder knocked
            off by the wind, and a ton of sand gone no one can tell where. In every
            storm their contour changes, and yet their general formation is so
            similar at all times that the change is seldom thought of. A coarse
            spear-like grass finds a sparse growth upon them, and does what it can
            to hold the sand in place; but it has a hard time of it, as its blades
            buried to their tips or its naked roots often testify.
        </p>
        <p>
            But there is one part of this Beach that is ever much the same. It is a
            broad, shelving strip of sand between the hills and the sea, where the
            tide rises and falls, pounding and grinding, year in and year out—the
            play-ground and the battle-ground of the surf.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a summer's day, I have seen this surf so low and quiet that one could
            launch a sharpie upon it, single-handed, and come ashore again without
            shipping a quart of water. At other times it is a terror to look at—a
            steady break of waves upon the outer bar, with row after row coming in,
            rearing and plunging as they strike the shore. In such a sea there is no
            launching yawl or surf-boat, and no coming ashore.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the tide is on the right moon and the wind has blown a gale from
            the southeast, the strand is entirely submerged, and people upon the
            main shore three miles away can see the surf breaking over the Beach
            hills.
